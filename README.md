# Phishing
This repository contains code and resources for detecting phishing websites using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Phishing attacks are a common form of online fraud where attackers try to deceive users into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, or personal information. To combat such attacks, this project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify and classify potential phishing websites.

The CNN model is trained on a dataset of labeled websites, where each website is categorized as either legitimate or phishing. By learning from patterns and features present in both types of websites, the model can make predictions about the nature of a given website.The CNN model used for phishing website detection consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers and a final output layer for binary classification (legitimate or phishing).
